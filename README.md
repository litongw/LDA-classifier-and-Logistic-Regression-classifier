# LDA-classifier-and-Logistic-Regression-classifier
Using zipcode data for the 3s, 5s, 8s, compare the following procedures with respect to training and test misclassification error: <br />
1. LDA on the original 256 dimensional space.<br />
2. LDA on the leading 49 principle components of the features.<br />
3. LDA when you filter the data as follows. Each non-overlapping 2 Ã— 2 pixel block is replaced by its average.<br />
4. Multiple linear logistic regression using the same filtered data as in the previous question.
